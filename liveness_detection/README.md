# Face Liveness Detection using Depth Map Prediction

## Project Description

This project utilizes a fusion of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Computer Vision techniques to distinguish between genuine and fake faces in real-time scenarios. The webcam captures image frames, which are then processed through a pre-trained model. This model is trained specifically on depth maps derived from the dataset. The depth map generation process is accomplished using a separate CNN model.
