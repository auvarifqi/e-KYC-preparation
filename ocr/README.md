# Text Recognition With TensorFlow and CTC network
In this preparation, we aim to enhance text recognition from images by integrating Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By combining these two methodologies, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of extracting text from images in various contexts, such as identity verification in e-KYC platforms that we are going to use in Lintasarta

There are two most popular methods that we could use to extract text from images:
- We can localize text in images using text detectors or segmentation techniques, then extract localized text (more straightforward way);
- We can train a model that achieves both text detection and recognition within a single model (the hard way);

In this tutorial, I will focus only on a word extraction part from the whole OCR pipeline:

But, it's valuable to know the pipeline of the most popular OCRs available today. As I said, most pipelines contain a Text Detection step and Text Recognition steps:

- **Text Detection** helps you identify the location of an image that contains the text. It takes an image as input and gives boxes with coordinates as output;
- **Text Recognition** extracts text from an input image using bounding boxes derived from a text detection model. It inputs an image with cropped image parts using the bounding boxes from the detector and outputs raw text.

Text detection is very similar to the Object Detection task, where the object which needs to be detected is nothing but the text. Much research has taken place in this field to detect text out of images accurately, and many detectors detect text at the word level. However, the problem with word-level detectors is that they fail to notice words of arbitrary shape (rotated, curved, stretched, etc.). 

But it was proven that we could achieve even better results by using various segmentation techniques instead of using detectors. Exploring each character and the spacings between characters helps to detect various shaped texts.[1]

For text detection, you can choose other popular techniques. But, as I already mentioned, it would be too complex and an extensive tutorial to cover both. So, I will focus on explaining the CTC networks for text recognition. 

I noticed that when developing various things, I must reimplement things I was already using over and over. So why not simplify this by creating a library to hold all this stuff? With this tutorial, I am starting a new MLTU (Machine Learning Training Utilities) library that I will open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/pythonlessons/mltu), where I'll save all tutorial code there.

## OCR and NLP Integration
By integrating OCR with NLP, we can enhance text recognition capabilities:
- **OCR Enhancement**: Implement advanced OCR techniques such as contextual analysis, entity recognition, and semantic understanding to improve text extraction accuracy and context comprehension.
- **NLP Integration**: Utilize NLP models to analyze the extracted text's semantics, understand relationships between different pieces of information, and validate and correct any inaccuracies.

### Benefits
- **Improved Accuracy**: Enhanced OCR with NLP integration leads to higher accuracy in interpreting and processing text, minimizing errors.
- **Efficient Processing**: NLP-driven contextual analysis reduces manual intervention, speeding up the verification process in e-KYC platforms.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: The combined OCR and NLP solution provides meaningful and structured text output, enhancing user experience and satisfaction.

## MLTU Library Initiative
To streamline the development process and avoid reimplementing common functionalities repeatedly, we're introducing the Machine Learning Training Utilities (MLTU) library. This library will contain reusable code for various machine learning tasks, including OCR and NLP integration. We'll open-source the library on [GitHub](https://github.com/pythonlessons/mltu), facilitating collaboration and code sharing within the community.

By synchronizing OCR and NLP, we aim to revolutionize text recognition capabilities, particularly in e-KYC platforms, ensuring secure and efficient identity verification processes.
